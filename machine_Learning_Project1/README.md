Project Description: Predicting Student Placement Package Based on CGPA
This project aims to predict the placement package of students based on their CGPA using Simple Linear Regression. The dataset consists of students' CGPA (independent variable) and their respective placement packages (dependent variable). The objective is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the package for a new student given their CGPA.

Key Features:
Dataset: The input dataset includes two columns:
CGPA: Academic performance of students.
Placement Package: Salary offered to students during placements.
Algorithm Used: Simple Linear Regression, as there is a single independent variable (CGPA).
Tools & Libraries:
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization and exploratory analysis.
Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating the machine learning model.
Workflow:
Load and preprocess the dataset.
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the relationship between CGPA and placement package.
Split the data into training and testing sets using train_test_split.
Train a Simple Linear Regression model on the training data.
Evaluate the model's performance on the test data.
Use the trained model to predict the placement package for a new student based on their CGPA.
Expected Outcome:
The project demonstrates how academic performance (CGPA) impacts placement packages and provides a predictive tool to estimate placement salaries for students based on their academic scores.
